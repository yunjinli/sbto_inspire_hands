"""Prepend a standing lead-in to an SBTO reference motion.

Why this exists: sub3_largebox_005 is a segment cut from the middle of a human
capture, so its frame 0 is mid-stride -- the peak joint velocity of the whole
clip (8.9 rad/s), the pelvis moving at 0.49 m/s, one foot 5 cm off the floor,
and the torso pitched 24 degrees over the box. Nothing downstream can start
there. A real robot cannot be placed into that state, and a policy handed over
from locomotion arrives upright, which is outside the tracker's basin: measured
in sim, the tracker needs the base pitched to within ~6 degrees of the
reference's 24, and a joint-space blend from standing cannot produce that lean
because the pose is not a static equilibrium.

Fixing it downstream is impossible; fixing it in SBTO's config is not enough
either, because tasks/g1/robot_object_ref.py sets the initial state from
``self.ref.x0`` unconditionally, overwriting any ``keyframe_x0``. So the fix is
to make ``ref.x0`` itself a standing pose: prepend frames that ease from a
standing keyframe into the demo's frame 0. The default is ``loco``, the pose the
deployed locomotion policy actually holds, so the eventual handover has nothing
to absorb. SBTO then optimises a dynamically feasible way to perform that lean,
and every stage after it -- the converted npz, the RL reset distribution, the
deployment handover -- inherits a start pose the robot can actually be in.

The lead-in does not need to be dynamically feasible. It is a tracking *cost*,
not a constraint.

    python scripts/prepend_motion_leadin.py \

        -o /path/to/sbto/sbto/tasks/g1/motion/sub3_largebox_005_leadin.npz

Then point ``cfg_ref.motion_path`` at the output and re-run SBTO. Note the
horizon grows by --seconds * fps frames (45 at the defaults, 193 -> 238, +23%),
so check the solver's T and t_knots budget before a long run.
